## I'm QA Engineer | ISTQB Certified Tester and I'm excited about what I'm doing and I am very happy to evaluate the quality of a software product and make sure that it meets the required expectations. At the same time I am eager to find errors, investigate and report them. I am an open and very communicative person who learns everything with great interest. I have experience in functional, integration, system testing and also have a complete understanding on creation and detailing of well-structured test cases, checklists and bug reports. Being aware of high responsibility for work performance and being very attentive to detail, I am always ready to put in the hard work to contribute to a team's success.
